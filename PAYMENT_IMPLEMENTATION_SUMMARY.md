# Payment Microservice Implementation Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive payment microservice has been successfully created for the Online Event Registration system. This service supports multiple payment gateways and provides a flexible, scalable architecture for processing payments.

## What Was Created

### 1. Service Architecture

#### Payment Gateway Interface
**File:** `app/Services/Payment/Contracts/PaymentGatewayInterface.php`

Defines the contract that all payment gateways must implement:
- `initiatePayment()` - Start a payment transaction
- `verifyPayment()` - Verify payment callback
- `getPaymentStatus()` - Get payment status
- `refundPayment()` - Process refunds
- `getGatewayName()` - Get gateway identifier

#### Payment Service
**File:** `app/Services/Payment/PaymentService.php`

Central orchestration service that:
- Manages all payment gateways
- Routes payments to appropriate gateway
- Handles payment callbacks and webhooks
- Updates registrant payment status
- Logs all payment activities

### 2. Payment Gateway Implementations

## How It Works

### Payment Flow

1. **Registration Completed**
   - User completes registration form
   - System creates registrant record with pending payment status
   - User redirected to payment page

2. **Payment Method Selection**
   - Frontend calls `/api/payment-methods/{regCode}`
   - System returns enabled payment methods
   - User selects preferred method

3. **Payment Processing**
   - Frontend calls `/api/process-payment/{regCode}`
   - PaymentService routes to appropriate gateway
   - Gateway initiates payment and returns response

4. **Gateway Interaction**
   
   **For Card/Online Payments:**
   - User redirected to payment gateway
   - Completes payment on gateway site
   - Gateway redirects back to `/payment/callback`
   - System verifies payment
   - Updates registrant status to "confirmed"
   
   **For Bank Transfer:**
   - System displays bank details and instructions
   - User completes transfer manually
   - User sends payment proof via email
   - Admin verifies via admin panel
   - System updates status to "confirmed"

5. **Webhook Processing**
   - Gateway sends async notification to `/payment/webhook`
   - System verifies webhook signature
   - Updates payment status if not already done
   - Logs transaction

## Integration Guide

### Backend Integration

The payment service is already integrated into the RegistrantController. To use it in your payment page:

```php
// In your controller
public function payment($regCode)
{
    $registrant = Registrant::where('regCode', $regCode)->firstOrFail();
    
    return view('pages.registration-payment', [
        'registrant' => $registrant,
    ]);
}
```

### Frontend Integration

In your payment view (e.g., `registration-payment.blade.php`):

```blade
@extends('layouts.app')

@section('content')
<div class="container mx-auto px-4 py-8">
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Complete Your Payment</h1>
    
    <!-- Include the payment methods component -->
    <x-payment-methods 
        :reg-code="$registrant->regCode"
        :amount="$registrant->netAmount"
        :currency="$registrant->programme->currency ?? 'SGD'"
    />
</div>
@endsection

<!-- Include payment service script -->
@push('scripts')
<script src="{{ asset('js/payment-service.js') }}"></script>
@endpush
```

### Custom Implementation

If you prefer a custom UI:

```javascript
// Initialize payment service
const paymentService = new PaymentService('EVENT2025_001');

// Load payment methods
const data = await paymentService.getPaymentMethods();
console.log(data.payment_methods);

// Process payment
await paymentService.initiatePayment('stripe');
```

## Environment Setup

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
# HitPay
HITPAY_ENABLED=true
HITPAY_SANDBOX=true
HITPAY_API_KEY=your_api_key
HITPAY_SALT=your_salt

# Stripe
STRIPE_ENABLED=true
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_xxx
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx

# PayPal
PAYPAL_ENABLED=true
PAYPAL_SANDBOX=true
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

# Bank Transfer
BANK_TRANSFER_ENABLED=true
BANK_NAME="DBS Bank"
BANK_ACCOUNT_NAME="Your Organization"
BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER="123-456-789"
BANK_SWIFT_CODE="DBSSSGSG"
```

## Database Migration

Run the migration to add payment columns:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Testing

### Test Mode
All gateways support test/sandbox modes. Ensure you enable sandbox mode in `.env`:

```env
HITPAY_SANDBOX=true
PAYPAL_SANDBOX=true
```

Use test API keys from Stripe:
```env
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

### Test Cards

**Stripe:**
- Success: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Decline: 4000 0000 0000 0002

**PayPal:**
- Use sandbox accounts from PayPal Developer Dashboard

## Webhook Configuration

Configure webhook URLs in your payment gateway dashboards:

- **URL:** `https://yourdomain.com/payment/webhook`
- **Events:** All payment events

## Production Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Update all API keys to production keys
- [ ] Set sandbox modes to `false`
- [ ] Configure webhook URLs in gateway dashboards
- [ ] Test each payment gateway
- [ ] Verify email notifications work
- [ ] Test bank transfer verification flow
- [ ] Enable HTTPS on your domain
- [ ] Review Laravel logs for any errors
- [ ] Test payment callback and webhook handling
- [ ] Verify refund functionality (if needed)

## Troubleshooting

### Payment not confirming
1. Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
2. Verify webhook URL is accessible
3. Test webhook with gateway's testing tools

### Gateway not showing
1. Verify `GATEWAY_ENABLED=true` in `.env`
2. Check API credentials
3. Review error logs

### Bank transfer instructions not showing
1. Check bank configuration in `.env`
2. Verify all required fields are set

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Email notifications on payment success/failure
- SMS notifications
- Partial refunds
- Payment plans/installments
- QR code generation for bank transfers
- Automated payment reconciliation
- Payment analytics dashboard

## Support

For issues:
1. Check Laravel logs first
2. Review gateway-specific documentation
3. Test in sandbox mode
4. Contact gateway support if gateway-specific issue

## Conclusion

The payment microservice is fully functional and ready to use. It provides a robust, scalable solution for processing payments in your online event registration system. The modular architecture makes it easy to maintain and extend with additional payment gateways in the future.
