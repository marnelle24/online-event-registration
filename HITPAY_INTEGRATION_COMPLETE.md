## Setup Requirements

### 1. Environment Configuration

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
# HitPay Configuration
HITPAY_ENABLED=true
HITPAY_SANDBOX=true
HITPAY_API_KEY=your_hitpay_api_key
HITPAY_SALT=your_hitpay_salt
```

### 2. JavaScript Asset

The payment service JavaScript needs to be accessible. You have two options:

#### Option A: Copy to Public Directory (Quick)
```bash
cp resources/js/payment-service.js public/js/payment-service.js
```

#### Option B: Include in Build Process (Recommended)
Add to `resources/js/app.js`:
```javascript
import './payment-service.js';
```

Then rebuild assets:
```bash
npm run build
# or for development
npm run dev
```

### 3. Database Migration

Run the payment migration if not already done:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 4. Configure HitPay Webhook

In your HitPay dashboard, set the webhook URL to:
```
https://yourdomain.com/payment/webhook
```

## Testing

### Test in Sandbox Mode

1. **Set sandbox mode:**
   ```env
   HITPAY_SANDBOX=true
   ```

2. **Use HitPay test credentials:**
   - Get test API key from HitPay sandbox
   - Get test salt from HitPay sandbox

3. **Test the flow:**
   - Complete a registration
   - Go to payment page
   - Click "Pay with PayNow"
   - Use HitPay sandbox payment methods
   - Complete payment
   - Verify redirect to confirmation page

### Test Scenarios

✅ **Successful Payment**
- Complete payment on HitPay
- Should redirect to confirmation page
- Registration status should be "confirmed"
- Payment status should be "paid"

✅ **Failed Payment**
- Cancel payment on HitPay
- Should show error message
- Registration status remains "pending"

✅ **Bank Transfer**
- Click "View Detailed Instructions"
- Modal should appear with bank details

## Production Deployment

### Before Going Live

1. **Update to production credentials:**
   ```env
   HITPAY_SANDBOX=false
   HITPAY_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
   HITPAY_SALT=your_production_salt
   ```

2. **Configure production webhook in HitPay dashboard**

3. **Test with small amount first**

4. **Monitor Laravel logs:** `storage/logs/laravel.log`

### Security Checklist

- ✅ HTTPS enabled on your domain
- ✅ CSRF token included in requests
- ✅ Webhook signature verification enabled
- ✅ API keys stored in .env (not in code)
- ✅ Payment amounts validated server-side

## Code Explanation

### Alpine.js Component

```javascript
function paymentPageData(regCode) {
    return {
        regCode: regCode,           // Registration code
        paymentService: null,       // Payment service instance
        processing: false,          // Loading state
        errorMessage: null,         // Error message display

        init() {
            // Initialize payment service on page load
            this.paymentService = new PaymentService(this.regCode);
        },

        async processHitPayPayment() {
            // Process HitPay payment
            // 1. Set loading state
            // 2. Call payment service
            // 3. Redirect to HitPay or show error
        },

        async processBankTransfer() {
            // Show bank transfer instructions modal
        }
    }
}
```

### Payment Service Integration

```javascript
// 1. Initialize
const paymentService = new PaymentService(regCode);

// 2. Process payment
const result = await paymentService.processPayment('hitpay');

// 3. Redirect to gateway
window.location.href = result.data.redirect_url;
```

## API Endpoints Used

### Process Payment
```
POST /api/process-payment/{regCode}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "payment_method": "hitpay"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "payment_method": "hitpay",
  "data": {
    "status": "initiated",
    "reference_no": "EVENT2025_001",
    "payment_url": "https://hit-pay.com/payment/xxx",
    "redirect_url": "https://hit-pay.com/payment/xxx"
  }
}
```

### Payment Callback
```
GET /payment/callback?reference_number=XXX&status=completed&hmac=XXX

Redirects to:
/registration/confirmation/{regCode}?success=true
```

## Troubleshooting

### Payment button not working
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify `payment-service.js` is loaded
3. Check Alpine.js is initialized

### Payment not redirecting
1. Check Laravel logs: `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`
2. Verify HitPay API credentials
3. Check if HitPay API is accessible

### Payment not confirming
1. Verify webhook URL is accessible
2. Check HMAC signature verification
3. Review payment logs

### Common Errors

**Error: "Payment gateway did not return a valid URL"**
- Check HitPay API credentials
- Verify API is enabled in .env
- Check Laravel logs for API errors

**Error: "Payment processing failed"**
- Network connection issue
- Invalid API key
- Check error message in browser console

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test payment flow in sandbox mode
2. ✅ Configure production credentials
3. ✅ Set up webhook in HitPay dashboard
4. ✅ Test with real payment (small amount)
5. ✅ Monitor initial transactions
6. ✅ Set up payment confirmation emails (optional)

## Additional Payment Gateways

- **Stripe** - Credit/debit cards
